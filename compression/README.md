# Compression 🗜️

This folder contains code for model pruning and quantization.

Please note that this repository does not include any pre-built compression tools or algorithms. Instead, you will need to add your own implementation of these techniques to the relevant files in this folder.

---

The `pruning_sample.py` file contains a script for pruning a neural network 🪓🧑‍💻. 

> Four pruning strategies based on <u>L1, L2, Level and FPGM</u> are implemented by NNI, and the ONNX format model is exported. It should be noted that, the pruned model has not been fine-tuned and is only a pruning example. (You can implement model pruning by writing code in **train.py** as described in **pruning_sample.py**)

The `quantize.py` file contains a script for quantizing a neural network 🔢🤖. Again, you will need to modify the code to specify your desired quantization methodology.

This part is not perfect, but will be posted later~~~💛💙💚

Thank you for your interest in this work!!😊
