# Checkpoints 🔍📁

This folder contains checkpoints for two models, `cls`  and `dcgan` .

## cls 🤖

The `cls` folder contains checkpoints for a CNN classification model. These checkpoints can be used to load the trained weights of the model and evaluate it on new data.

## dcgan 🎨

The `dcgan` folder contains checkpoints for a DCGAN image generation model. These checkpoints can be used to load the trained weights of the model and generate new images.

That's all! 😊
